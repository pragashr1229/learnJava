
Data Structures
A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.

Arrays:
-------
An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type in a contiguous memory location. 
It is a data structure which is used to store finite number of elements and all elements must be of similar data type.

Arrays are index based data structure so they allow random access to elements, they store. Indices start with '0'.

Array example
int[] a = new int[5];
 
a[0] = 1;
a[1] = 2;
a[2] = 4;
a[3] = 8;
a[4] = 16;


 Types of Array in Java:
 ----------------------
 1.Single Dimensional Array
 2.Multi-dimensional Array
 
Single Dimensional Array:
-------------------------
 Array declaration
type var-name[];
OR
type[] var-name;
 
//Examples
 
int[] numbers;
 
String names[];

Multi-dimensional Array:
------------------------
Multi-dimensional array declaration
type var-name[][];
OR
type[][] var-name;
 
//Examples
 
int[][] cordinates;
 
String nameSets[][];


LinkedList:
----------
The LinkedList stores its items in "containers/nodes." 
The list has a link to the first container and each container has a link to the next container in the list. 
To add an element to the list, the element is placed into a new container and that container is 
linked to one of the other containers in the list.

A node has data and reference to next node in list
First node is the head node
Last node has the data and points to null.

Stack:
------
The class is based on the basic principle of LIFO,FIFO. 
In addition to the basic push and pop operations, the class provides three more functions of empty, search, and peek.
