
Java I/O (Input and Output) is used to process the input and produce the output.

The java.io package contains all the classes required for input and output operations.

Stream - A stream is a sequence of data. 

In Java, 3 streams are created for us automatically. All these streams are attached with the console.

1) System.out: standard output stream

2) System.in: standard input stream

3) System.err: standard error stream

InputStream
===========
Java application uses an input stream to read data from a source; 
it may be a file, an array, peripheral device or socket.

OutputStream
============
OutputStream class is an abstract class. It is the superclass of all classes 
representing an output stream of bytes. 
An output stream accepts output bytes and sends them to some sink.

Useful methods of OutputStream
Method	Description
1) public void write(int) throws IOException  :: is used to write a byte to the current output stream.
2) public void write(byte[]) throws IOException :: is used to write an array of byte to the current output stream.
3) public void flush() throws IOException :: flushes the current output stream.
4) public void close() throws IOException :: is used to close the current output stream.


Useful methods of InputStream
Method	Description
1) public abstract int read()throws IOException :: 	reads the next byte of data from the input stream. It returns -1 at the end of the file.
2) public int available()throws IOException	 :: returns an estimate of the number of bytes 
												that can be read from the current input stream.
3) public void close()throws IOException :: is used to close the current input stream.
